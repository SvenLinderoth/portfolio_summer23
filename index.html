            <h1>Cloud Hop</h1>
            <p> In this project we had alot of creative freedom which was really fun. 
                In this project i did all the pixelart myself, which was a first and i learnt alot. 
                <br> Their was much trial and error. Firstly i created the music myself, but found it not to fit with the pixel genre. 
                <br> Therefor i found some free music, since the time was limited in the regard that i did everything else myself. 
                <br><br> This project helped me learn alot about developing using a SDK. 
                <br> It also just helped me understand much about developing in general. It was a very fun project and made me even more eager to keep working and gain experience in this field.

                <br>
                <i>in store - webcam project</i>
            </h1>
      
            <p> This project was very fun and i had lots of creative freedom in the assignment given by LNU. 
                We had to do research about possible use of virtual screens in stores, and then create this with the user in mind. 
                This project helped me develop various skills and a greater understanding. 
                The main focus of this project though was UX/UI and to further develop my front-end skills. 
                <br><br>    
                The result was a fun and interactive screen that were meant for the user to take a picture with the webcamera, and try on clothes virtually. 
                The idea was from me, and the skills to do so were limited, but i did my best within my knowledge at the time and i learned alot of small things from this project. 
                <br><br>
                Im somewhat proud about this project since i was fairly new to designing something on my own with research and prototyping, and the project got graded A.

            <h1>Trip-it</h1>
            <p> In this project we were three people cooperating by using the schools API. 
                This API stored information that we had to use for our application. 
                <br><br>
                We had an assigned focused group and task, and were somewhat limited in what to do with the API.
                The focus of this project was to gain a greater knowledge in how you can work using application protocol interfaces. 
                <br><br>
                This project overall helped me understand how an API can be used and why it could be beneficial during development. 
                Later on in my second year of University, <i> (this project is from my first year) </i>, i then created my own API in PHP that dealt with connection to a database, and this certainly helped me understand how the data is retrieved and used.

            <h1> Blog project </h1>
            <p> This was a somewhat big project in terms of research and developing a deeper understanding of how to both create and implement a API. 
                <br><br>
                In this project i did mainly three things. 
                <br>
                1. Create a database with Apache.
                <br> 
                2. Create a API in PHP that dealt with given database and handled user logins etc. 
                <br>
                3. Create a application in Electron which let users login to the application, and then create and delete blog posts that they had made.

            I have had many other projects that has helped me gain knowledge in web-development.

            Although these were some i wanted to highlight for you all,
